# Angular Course
Welcome to my Angular Course repository! Here, you'll find my personal notes, summaries, and examples as I progress through studying Angular topics. This repository is organized to reflect the different concepts and practices covered during the course.

## Content
The repository includes:
* Notes on Angular fundamentals (components, templates, modules, and more).
* Examples and exercises to demonstrate various Angular concepts.
* My insights and explanations to deepen understanding of the material.

## Course and Contributions
This repository serves as a personal learning log for my progress throughout the course. Most of the information is based on the course materials provided by SoftUni, but I have expanded on them with my own notes and insights.

If you are also studying web development, feel free to refer to these files as additional learning resources. However, keep in mind that these are based on my individual learning journey and may not cover every aspect of Angular comprehensively.
